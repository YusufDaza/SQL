# SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

### What was your motivation?
- My motivation for developing this command-line application was to create a user-friendly interface for business owners to efficiently manage their company's employee database.

### Why did you build this project?
- I built this project to address the common need among businesses to have a streamlined system for handling employee data. By leveraging Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL, I aimed to create a robust and intuitive application that enables users to perform essential tasks such as viewing, adding, and updating employee-related information seamlessly.

### What problem does it solve?
- This project solves the problem of manual and cumbersome management of employee data in a company. By providing a command-line interface with options to view, add, and update departments, roles, and employees, it offers a convenient and efficient solution for business owners to organize their workforce data effectively.

### What did you learn?
- Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building command-line applications using Node.js and interacting with databases like PostgreSQL. I learned how to integrate user input functionalities using Inquirer and manage database operations such as querying, inserting, and updating data. 

## Installation

- 1. Navigate to the project directory.
- 2. Install `npm install`.
- 3. Once npm are installed and the database is set up, run the application using the following command `node index.js`.
- 4. Follow the prompts and select the desired options (e.g., view all departments, add a role, update an employee role, etc.) to interact with the application and manage the company's employee database.
